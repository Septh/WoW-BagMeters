# BagMeters
#### No more *"This bag is full"* messages. Ever. ####

## Purpose
BagMeters displays the free and total slots per bag (character and bank bags) in an attractive, easy-to-read manner. You always see which bags are full and which are not.

Current translations are available for English (default) and French.


## Configuration
BagMeters does offer a few settings for you to play with. To access them, you can either:

1. use World of Warcraft configuration panel
1. type `/bagmeters` (or just `/bm`) in your chat.


## Help
Comments are disabled on Curse.com and on Curseforge.com. Should you need any help, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Septh/WoW-BagMeters/issues "GitHub repository"), where the projet lives.


## History
I created BagMeters a few years ago but never uploaded it to Curse. Shame on me.

This release is a full rewrite using the latest Ace3 libraries.

BagMeters is an original creation but it was heavilly inspired by [Bag Status Meter](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/project-99/ "Bag Status Meter"), by Madorin. Bag Status Meter is no longer maintained since... 2006 - yeah, that's 10 years.


## Licence
BagMeters is released under the MIT licence.

Enjoy!
